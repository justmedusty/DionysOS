✓Serial

✓Load a new GDT

✓Load an IDT so that exceptions and interrupts can be handled.

✓Write a physical memory allocator, a good starting point is a bitmap allocator.

✓Write a virtual memory manager that can map, remap and unmap pages.

Begin parsing ACPI tables, the most important one is the MADT since it contains information about the APIC.

Start up the other CPUs. Limine provides a facility to make this less painful.

Set up an interrupt controller such as the APIC.

Configure a timer such as the Local APIC timer, the PIT, or the HPET.

Implement a scheduler to schedule threads in order make multitasking possible.

Design a virtual file system (VFS) and implement it. The traditional UNIX VFS works and saves headaches when porting software, but you can make your own thing too.

Implement a simple virtual file system like a memory-only tmpfs to avoid crippling the design of your VFS too much while implementing it alongside real storage filesystems.

Decide how to abstract devices. UNIX likes usually go for a /dev virtual filesystem containing device nodes and use ioctl() alongside standard FS calls to do operations on them.

Get a userland going by loading executables from your VFS and running them in ring 3. Set up a way to perform system calls.

Write a PCI driver.

Add support for a storage medium, the easiest and most common ones are AHCI and NVMe.

### Makefile targets

Running `make all` will compile the kernel (from the `kernel/` directory) and then generate a bootable ISO image.

Running `make all-hdd` will compile the kernel and then generate a raw image suitable to be flashed onto a USB stick or hard drive/SSD.

Running `make run-x86` will build the kernel and a bootable ISO (equivalent to make all) and then run it using `qemu` (if installed).

Running `make run-hdd` will build the kernel and a raw HDD image (equivalent to make all-hdd) and then run it using `qemu` (if installed).

The `run-uefi` and `run-hdd-uefi` targets are equivalent to their non `-uefi` counterparts except that they boot `qemu` using a UEFI-compatible firmware.
